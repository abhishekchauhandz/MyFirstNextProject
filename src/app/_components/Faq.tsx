              Patients and guests don&apos;t mind watching cable television or special health related content on closed circuit systems. The question is “how does this benefit the practice?” Flairtab is dedicated to promoting the practice from within by delivering information such as health tips, office hours, doctor and staff credentials, health alerts, and patient discounts.

              No. The practice will be given ten static images that Flairtab will create at no charge with the practice retaining full creative liberty. Additionally, if the practice already has or desires to produce video and wants it to be shown in the waiting area over Flairtab’s system, we will host and stream the video content through our system.

              Unless there are special circumstances, the typical installation lasts no more than 15-20 minutes. The more information that we have about the type of TV or network requirements, the quicker it will take. If a new TV is involved that requires mounting the time could take a little longer.

              We generally know when there is a problem with programming and can sometimes act before anyone notices. That being said, we are always available during working hours to handle a call informing us that there is a problem. Once we are made aware of the problem we will either resolve it remotely or dispatch a technician to physically inspect the unit.

              Yes. You can absolutely add another location or even add service to another TV in the same office building. Each location should meet the same requirements including visibility to a captive audience.

              We simply ask that you protect the equipment from harm or any other potential risk that would prevent it from operating properly. We also ask that the system run continuously during office hours unless there is a power outage or other circumstance which beyond the control of your office.
